# yelp-dataset
This is an analysis that I performed on a real-world dataset from Yelp.

The objective of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the provided Yelp dataset and determine if there were any correlations within the data through analysis. I looked at data regarding users, businesses, and reviews to profile the data and identify any patterns.

I used SQL to profile and clean the data, and write the necessary queries to complete my analyses of the data.

For the first part of this project, I profiled the data to better understand the design of the Yelp dataset and how the data tables relate to each other. Using SQL, I performed a series of queries to find out information about what kind of users were writing reviews, whether the location of a business affected its reviews and ratings, and what types of reviews were being written.

For the second part of this project, I analyzed different aspects of the dataset to find patterns between users and businesses.
